# **Job Suitability Score Distributions Across Industries and Roles**

## **Introduction**
This visualization examines how **job suitability scores** vary **across industries and job roles**. It aims to explore whether **different roles (client-facing vs. back-office) receive systematically different ratings within Finance and Retail industries**.  

The data comes from **participant ratings** of job suitability for individuals in different roles, allowing us to analyze **whether industry and role type influence perceived job suitability**.

## **Understanding the Visualization**
The density plot below shows the **distribution of mean job suitability scores** for different job roles across two industries.  

- **X-axis**: Mean suitability score rated per stimulus.  
- **Y-axis**: Density, representing the distribution of ratings.  
- **Facets**: The plot is split into **Finance** (top panel) and **Retail** (bottom panel) to highlight industry-specific differences.  
- **Colors**:  
  - **Green (Client-facing roles)**: Financial Advisor & Retail Sales Associate  
  - **Pink (Back-office roles)**: Risk Analyst & Inventory Manager  
- **Dashed vertical lines**: Represent the **mean suitability score** for each role, with **numerical labels** indicating their values.

## **Key Findings**
### **1. Finance Industry (Top Panel)**
- **Client-facing (Mean = 55.97) vs. Back-office (Mean = 55.25)**  
- The distributions are **highly overlapping**, suggesting that suitability scores for **Finance** roles are **consistent regardless of whether the job is client-facing or back-office**.
- This indicates that in the **Finance industry**, there may be **less appearance-based bias** in suitability judgments.

### **2. Retail Industry (Bottom Panel)**
- **Client-facing (Mean = 61.4) vs. Back-office (Mean = 56.12)**  
- Unlike in Finance, a **clearer separation** emerges, with **Client-facing roles receiving higher suitability scores** than Back-office roles.  
- This suggests that in **Retail**, people may perceive **client-facing jobs as requiring different traits**, potentially reflecting **appearance-based or personality-driven stereotypes**.

---

## **Implications & Next Steps**
- **Industry differences**: **Retail** shows stronger differentiation in job suitability ratings than **Finance**.  
- **Potential biases**: This may suggest **a preference for certain visual traits** in **customer-facing roles** within the Retail sector.  
- **Further investigation**: A statistical test (e.g., t-tests, regression) will confirm whether these **differences are statistically significant**.

This research helps us better understand how **job suitability perceptions differ by industry and role type**, with potential implications for **hiring practices and workplace biases**.
