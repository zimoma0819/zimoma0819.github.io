# I have a webpage!

And I can put all kinds of stuff on it!

Here we've got some general setup for your webpage. 

# Here is a heading

[This links to other pages!](about)



## Advancing your skills

You can take what we've done here and do additional adaptations. 

For example, you can explore other formats, [such as prettydoc](https://prettydoc.statr.me/) as it will give you greater customization. 

### Custom CSS
If you're looking to REALLY customize, you can add a custom.css file. You can see there is an example css file here that can make some changes. To add them, you can add `css: custom.css', indenting it under 'html' in [the _site.yml](_site.yml) file.
