## Stay Curious, Stay Compassionate

Hello! I'm Zimo (Zina) Ma, a graduate student at the University of Chicago, where I am pursuing a Master of Arts in Computational Social Science, expected to graduate in June 2025. My academic and professional journey is a blend of technical rigor with social consciousness, aiming to leverage data science to decode complex human behaviors and drive equitable solutions.



### Education Backgrounds

I graduated from DePauw University with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in both Mathematics and Psychology. This interdisciplinary education enables me to integrate quantitative modeling with deep behavioral insights, providing a robust foundation for tackling complex challenges. Currently, as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, I am pursuing a Master of Arts in Computational Social Science, expected to graduate in June 2025. 




### Future Goals

Looking ahead, I aim to further my expertise in machine learning and data visualization, with the goal of contributing to innovative solutions in social science and policy-making. I am particularly interested in the intersection of technology and social impact, aspiring to create tools and models that promote equity and understanding across diverse communities.
