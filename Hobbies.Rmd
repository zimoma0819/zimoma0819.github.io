## Interests and Hobbies

From a young age, I have been deeply engaged in the arts, particularly through studying Chinese folk dances and playing piano. This early passion for dance not only connected me with my cultural heritage but also cultivated a deep appreciation for expressive movement and storytelling through art.

Upon entering undergraduate studies at DePauw University, I continued to pursue my passion for dance by joining the X-CELL Dance Team for four years and eventually taking on the role of Vice President, Choreographer, and Parliamentarian. My responsibilities included recording and creating memorial videos to preserve our team's rich history, choreographing performances that blended diverse cultural influences such as Majorette-style dances, Afrobeats, and traditional Chinese movements, and leading the team in organizing major events like our annual showcase and Mock Shaadi performance. I also monitored the progress of each executive memberâ€™s individual projects, ensuring alignment with our collective goals.

X-CELL became my safe zone and family, where our bonds grew incredibly strong. We spent almost every day together, whether dancing, studying, or just hanging out. Especially during my senior year, as we faced the grueling demands of "Hell Week" for our showcase rehearsals, finals, and my thesis, we often pulled all-nighters in the study rooms, tirelessly working on our assignments and even sleeping there. This intense, shared commitment not only deepened our friendships but also instilled a profound sense of resilience and teamwork.

These experiences have been some of the most joyful and precious moments of my life, fostering a deep bond that has become a treasured source of strength and happiness. Through dance, I promoted intercultural dialogue and fostered a sense of community among students from diverse backgrounds. My journey through dance has not only been a source of personal fulfillment but has significantly enhanced my leadership and organizational skills, contributing to both my personal and professional development.
